<h1>MOVIES BY ADEBOYEJO GIDEON</h1> 
<h2>Top 5 movies of all time.</h2> 

<hr />

<h3>Breath Of Life</h3>
I love the movie because it exhudes quality, the casts did absolutely great job, they won many awards in the last AMVCA 5.0

<h3>John Wick</h3>
i love the plot and setting of the movie, less film trick and topnotch acting

<h3>Far from Home</h3>
I particularly love how ashaya and government played their roles so effortlessly

<H3>A Tribe called Judah</H3>
Funke Akindele is a renowened movie producer, litle wonder the movie broke box office records, its a film no Nigerian should miss as the the plot setting is entirely Nigerian



<h3>Afamefunna</h3>
its the most notable Nigerian movie that illustrates the African apprentiship system although emphasizes on Eastern Nigeria but its worth watching as there are many lessons to pick from it.
